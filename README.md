# Machine Learning Project
 Repository of the ML project for DSE@unimi.

This project aims to develop a convolutional nerual network for image classification. 
To replicate the results, first run the `data_prep` notebook, where the pre-processing of the data is carried out. Ultimately, four pickled objects will be created. 
These objects will be then employed in the `analysis` notebook. <br> 
The two reports are the exact same document, but in the "declaration" version, the declaration of non-plagiarism is present. 
I left the document without the declaration for transparency purposes.
